# 1. Description
- This is a <b>machine learning project using Random Forest to predict credit risk of German Bank's customers.</b> It involves supervised learning (using a labeled training set) for <b>classification</b>, where the target is 1 if the customer represents a <b>bad risk</b> and 0 if he represents a <b>good risk</b>.

# 2. Business problem and project objective.
<b>Predict credit risk of German Bank's customers.</b><br>

<b>Credit risk</b> refers to the potential financial loss that a lender, such as a bank, might incur if a borrower fails to repay a loan or credit obligation. It's the uncertainty about whether borrowers will honor their financial commitments.

<b>The German Bank aims to predict their customers' credit risk for several reasons:</b><br>
1. Risk assessment
2. Profitability
3. Minimize losses
4. Compliance
5. Customer segmentation
6. Strengthen trust

By employing <b>predictive models</b>, the <b>bank</b> can make <b>informed decisions</b> that <b>balance profit generation with prudent risk management</b>, ultimately benefiting both the institution and its customers. Thus, the <b>project objective is to build a model that is able to identify as many as possible bad risk customers and provide valuable insights about credit risk within the available features.</b> By doing this, the business problem is solved.
