# 1. Description
- In this project, I have built a <b>machine learning model to predict credit risk of German Bank's customers.</b>. It involves <b>supervised learning (using a labeled training set) for classification</b>, where the <b>target</b> is <b>1</b> if the <b>customer</b> represents a <b>bad risk</b>, and <b>0</b> if they represent a <b>good risk</b>.
