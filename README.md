# 1. Description

# 2. Business problem and project objective.
<b>Predict credit risk of German Bank's customers.</b><br>

<b>Credit risk</b> refers to the potential financial loss that a lender, such as a bank, might incur if a borrower fails to repay a loan or credit obligation. It's the uncertainty about whether borrowers will honor their financial commitments.

<b>The German Bank aims to predict their customers' credit risk for several reasons:</b><br>
1. Risk assessment
2. Profitability
3. Minimize losses
4. Compliance
5. Customer segmentation
6. Strengthen trust

By employing <b>predictive models</b>, the <b>bank</b> can make <b>informed decisions</b> that <b>balance profit generation with prudent risk management</b>, ultimately benefiting both the institution and its customers. Thus, the project objective is to build a model that is able to identify as many as possible bad risk customers and provide valuable insights about credit risk within the available features. By doing this, the business problem is solved.
